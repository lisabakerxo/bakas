          <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">You're scrolling through your discord dms, and you come across a really hot pfp. "Looks like a korean bl character ovo", you think to yourself, something inside you faintly remembering this picture.</p>
          <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">You open the dm, and see someone, you might not have talked to in a while. Days...weeks...months..maybe even years.</p>
          <p style="width: 75%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">Maybe you're thinking about this asappapery dude, trying to remember where you knew him from, when you stumble onto the pinned messages. "Damn I looked good back then too~ uvu", you're probably thinking to yourself. But then...you see a link.</p>

            <p>This is a website your davey made. Probably haven't heard of that name in a bit though ;3</p>
            <p>Consider this a refresher, about one of your relationships. Most of them good...some bad ;p. Maybe this was one of those good ones? ;o, and if it's one of those bad ones......you probably have your davey to thank for it~ ;3.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px ;">This website was made in a weekend, so it might be a little...bare...but it'll get there~ ;3</p>

            <p>It was the 22nd of January. And you did something you'd regret forever. You sat next to a guy, 𓆩𝕯𝖆𝖛𝖊𓆪. Fancy name, I know. It was the first time we ever matched fits.</p>
            <p>He flirted with you, like many other girls before, he didn't think too much about this of course. But as they flirted, he realised, "Hey she was kinda cute ;o". But then she had to leave for her dumb factory job <span style="color: #ffabe1;">xc.</span></p>
            <p>Well last time they'd ever talk again he guessed.... But wait...she said she'd add him...oh well guess he could talk to her for a few days before moving on to someone else ;p</p>

            <p>She gave him her discord. "Oh~ Guess we might talk a little more than I expected", he thought to himself.</p>
            <p>After a few days of talking, he asked..."You could watch akame ga kill with me too~ ;3", he never really did this before. He wondered why he told her this.</p>
            <p>And god they flirted. All over the place. They meshed well. Two irresponsible adults. Two bakas who had their baka trust issues. And her davey placed his classic love traps all over the place. And his pretty little baka baka princess fell into every.single.one.</p>
            <p>She was <span style="color: #ffabe1;">toast.</span></p>
